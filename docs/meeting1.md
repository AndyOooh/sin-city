# Meeting 1 - December 8 

We had a breakout-room session of 20-30 mins discussing the project.
Danny had presented our idea to Matheus who recommended not putting the gaming logic on the blockchain. The issue is gas costs. Some subjects that were discussed:
- DEX or gaming platform first
- Tech stack
- Github rules


For a better chance of finishing a MVP it was decided we are a DEX first and if time allows we will have some small games as well. 
The following is not set in stone but it’s where we currently are at:
- Frontend: React with typescript.
- Styling: SASS or TailwindCSS
- Backend: NestJS
- It was also  discussed to have a template for PRs and rules for merging to main but nothing was decided.

We will all continue to get a DEX up and running individually. We are working with two methods of implementation:
- Fork Uniswap contracts (core and periphery)
- Utilize 1inch’s already deployed contracts.

There are tutorials on both in Notion.

We aim to have a DEX running by the end of the weekend so we can focus on gaming before  project submission next Thursday.

Next meeting will be either Friday or Saturday. A Doodle has been sent out.
